**<h1>Nashville Housing Price Prediction Project</h1>**

This project aims to predict housing prices in Nashville by analyzing a rich dataset of property information. The data is transformed and cleansed using SQL, allowing for insightful analysis of factors influencing property values.

<h3>Data Overview</h3>

The dataset includes the following attributes:

&emsp;•	UniqueID: A unique identifier for each record.</p>
&emsp;•	ParcelID: An identifier for the property parcel.</p>
&emsp;•	LandUse: Classification of land use (e.g., Single Family).</p>
&emsp;•	PropertyAddress: Physical address of the property.</p>
&emsp;•	SaleDate: Date when the property was sold.</p>
&emsp;•	SalePrice: Sale price of the property.</p>
&emsp;•	Owner Information: Details of the property owner.</p>
&emsp;•	Land and Building Values: Financial valuation of the land and building structures.</p>
&emsp;•	Property Features: Characteristics such as year built, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.</p>


<h3>Key Insights and Findings</h3>

1.	Market Trends:</br>

&emsp;•	An upward trend in property prices has been observed over the last decade. This is indicative of Nashville's growing real estate market, driven by factors such as population growth and urban development.</br>
&emsp;•	Properties sold in recent years tend to have higher prices, likely reflecting inflation and increased demand.</br>

2.	Impact of Property Age:</br>

&emsp;•	Properties built within the last 20 years command higher prices on average compared to older properties, suggesting a preference for newer constructions among buyers.</br>
&emsp;•	Older homes, while generally priced lower, show potential for investment opportunities given Nashville's historical significance and charm.</br>

3.	Geographical Influence:</br>

&emsp;•	Properties located in urban centers and affluent neighborhoods (e.g., Green Hills, Belle Meade) have significantly higher sale prices. This aligns with the desirability of these locations due to amenities, schools, and proximity to business hubs.</br>
&emsp;•	Conversely, properties in suburban or rural areas are more affordable, making them attractive options for first-time homebuyers or those seeking more space.</br>

4.	Influence of Property Features:</br>

&emsp;•	Larger properties with more bedrooms and bathrooms consistently achieve higher sale prices. This trend highlights the demand for spacious living, especially among families.</br>
&emsp;•	Acreage also plays a significant role, with larger plots of land increasing the overall property value.</br>

5.	Land vs. Building Value:</br>

&emsp;•	Analysis shows that the building's value significantly contributes to the total property value, especially in urban areas where land is scarce. In contrast, rural properties often have a higher land value percentage.</br>
